# Casetext Terms of Service

Effective as of December 2, 2016

While Casetext is primarily used by lawyers, it's also a resource for the public. We've tried to make our Terms of Service as straightforward as possible.

This is a contract ("Agreement") between you and Casetext Inc. ("Casetext," "we," or "us"), applicable when you use sites, services, mobile applications, products, and content provided by Casetext, in existence now or in the future ("Casetext Services", "Casetext", or "Services").

# These terms are a binding agreement

Even if your eyes normally glaze over legalese, please read this agreement carefully before you use Casetext. For one thing, we want your feedback and suggestions on how to make our policies better in support of our mission. (Email your input to [policies@casetext.com](mailto:policies@casetext.com).) More importantly, by accessing or using Casetext Services, you agree to be bound by everything in this Agreement, and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the [Casetext Privacy Policy](https://casetext.com/privacy), whether or not you are a registered user of our Services. **If you don't agree, please don't use Casetext.**

Subscriber’s payment(s) of Fees and applicable Taxes shall be due within 30 days after the date of Casetext's invoice(s), or such other period as may be stated on the Subscription Agreement. Late payments may accrue interest at a monthly rate of 1% of the overdue balance.

Casetext will provide the Subscription Services commencing on the Effective Date for the Initial Term indicated on the Subscription Agreement (or, if none is indicated, an Initial Term of one year), and thereafter for successive one-year renewal terms commencing on each anniversary of the Effective Date (“Renewal Terms”), unless and until the subscription is terminated with respect to any or all of the Subscribed Services as provided in Section I.B.5.ii or I.B.5.iii. 

ii. Termination by Subscriber.

We may offer limited pre-subscription trials to potential subscribers and individual users. When you're using Casetext on a trial, you are authorized to use one or more of the Casetext Subscription Services for a limited period of time, all as determined by us in our sole discretion. All Authorized Users of Trial Services are subject to the same terms and use restrictions as Subscribers.

## C. Access and Usage Restrictions

For information about Casetext's subscription services, email [sales@casetext.com](mailto:sales@casetext.com).

By using Casetext Services you agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities:

1. You will not engage in any bulk downloading or automatic scraping of the materials in Casetext Services.
2. You will not use any automated system to access Casetext Services in a manner that sends more request messages to Casetext's servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional online web browser. The sole exception is that Casetext grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy certain materials from Casetext Services for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials. Casetext reserves the right to restrict the content that public search engines are authorized to copy or index, or revoke part or all of that right at any time. Casetext presumptively does, but is under no obligation to, exclude user-generated Republished Content from the content public search engines are authorized to copy or index.
3. You will not take any action that imposes, or may impose, an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure as determined by Casetext.
4. You will not bypass the measures Casetext may use to prevent or restrict access, use, or copying of Casetext Services.

# II. Publishing & Sharing on Casetext

## A. Your Content

Casetext Services include the ability to publish articles, legal analysis, commentary, case updates, and other written information to the public Casetext website (referred to in these Terms as "content"). Attorneys and other authors publish this content to reach the wider legal community through Casetext's legal research platform, both through Free Services and Subscription Services. We don't claim any ownership over this content. We don't claim ownership over any of it. However, by posting or transferring content to Casetext, you give us permission to use your content to do all the things we believe, in Casetext's sole discretion, help us to provide the Casetext Services, including, without limitation, storing, displaying, reproducing, and distributing your content. This may include promoting your content on other online platforms and with partner companies or services for broader broadcast, distribution, or publication. We want your content to be read by the people who'll find it most useful and interesting.

Casetext is a community-driven resource, and accessing your contributions will always be free on Casetext. We will never sell your content to third parties without your explicit permission.

By publishing on Casetext, you agree to allow others to view your content. You also hereby grant others the right to: (a) share, post adapt, or otherwise use Original Content for any purpose under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license, and in accordance with the "Sharing other users' content" section below; and (b) share, post, adapt or otherwise use Republished Content for any purpose, in accordance with the "Sharing other users' content" section below.

We have the right (though no obligation) to remove any content you post, transfer to, or republish on Casetext Services for any reason or no reason. All content you post on Casetext is governed by this Agreement, and any violation may result in your content being permanently deleted without notice.

You are free to delete your content from Casetext at any time, though there may be a delay in removing it from public view due to operational requirements. If you delete your account or content, it may be permanently unrecoverable.

Casetext takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any user content that you or any other user or third party posts, sends, or otherwise makes available over the Services. You're responsible for the content you submit to Casetext and assume all risks associated with it, including anyone else's reliance on its accuracy, or claims relating to intellectual property or other legal rights. By posting, you represent that you own or have the necessary rights to post the content on Casetext, and that doing so doesn't conflict with any other licenses you've granted.

## B. Republishing Your Content

We get a lot of questions about whether you can post content you own on Casetext if you've already posted it elsewhere, like on your blog or professional website. The answer is yes. If you own the content, you're welcome to copy it from other places and publish it on Casetext (and vice versa) as long as you didn't give exclusive rights to other platforms or publishers.

In fact, we've had so much demand by users to republish content that they've previously published on their blogs that we built a feature to automatically import your blog and link your posts to the cases and statutes they cite. Note that just as publishing original content on Casetext indicates that you agree to allow others to view your content and distribute it with full attribution to you, republishing content that you previously published elsewhere is governed by similar rules (details below).

## C. Publishing Restrictions

Casetext is an online legal community where users post thoughtful legal commentary to peers, clients, students, and others for the purpose of advancing the collective understanding, demonstrating thought leadership, and building connections in the legal community. We expect all users to contribute content with that purpose in mind.

Because Casetext is a shared space, and we want many different ideas to thrive, we need to have a few ground rules. By using Casetext, you represent, warrant, and agree that you will not contribute any content that:

1. Infringes, violates, or otherwise interferes with any copyright or trademark of another person or entity.
2. Reveals any trade secret, unless you own the trade secret or have the owner's permission to post it.
3. Infringes any intellectual property right of another.
4. Is libelous, defamatory, abusive, threatening, harassing, hateful, offensive, humiliating to other people, obscene, profane, or otherwise violates any law or right of any person. We encourage users to speak freely on matters and people of legal and public interest, but we do not tolerate abusive behavior directed at private individuals.
5. Contains a virus, Trojan horse, worm, time bomb, or other computer programming routine or engine that is intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept, or expropriate any system, data, or information.
6. Contains information that violates others' privacy, including personally identifying or confidential information like credit card numbers, social security numbers, or non-public contact information.
7. Contains any information or content that is illegal (including but not limited to disclosure of insider information under securities law).
8. Seeks to harm or exploit minors by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details, or otherwise.
9. Contains spam, deceptive tags or links, malicious code, deceptive means to generate revenue or traffic, or otherwise misleads other users about what you've posted. Don't post content with the primary purpose of affiliate marketing.
10. Involves deceptive impersonation, phishing, or other frauds.
11. Registers accounts or posts content automatically, systematically, or programmatically.

We reserve the right to erase any content in violation of these rules, and to ban the IP address of users that post prohibited content. We do our best to act fairly, but we always reserve the right to suspend accounts or remove content, without notice, for any reason, but particularly to protect our services, infrastructure, users, or community. We reserve the right to enforce, or not enforce, these policies at our sole discretion, and these policies don't create a duty or contractual obligation for us to act in any particular manner.

## D. Sharing other users' content

You may use content originally published by users on Casetext ("Original Content") under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. Your use of content republished on Casetext by the copyright owner after initially having been published elsewhere ("Republished Content") is governed by different rules. The rules relating to attribution differ depending on whether the content you're sharing is an annotation, post, or article originally published on Casetext (i.e. Original Content), or if it is Republished Content.

**Original Content** : If you share, post, or otherwise use Original Content outside of Casetext, you agree that you will follow the Creative Commons attribution rules, including as follows:

1. You will ensure that any use clearly indicates the author names.
2. You will ensure that any use on the internet will hyperlink each author name directly back to his or her Casetext user profile.
3. You will ensure that any use on the internet includes a hyperlink directly to the original page on Casetext where the Original Content appears.

**Republished Content.** Authors of Republished Content have provided explicit permission to post the full text of their content on Casetext. Republished Content may include a hyperlink to a third-party website where that content was originally published. You can share or post Republished Content outside of Casetext only in accordance with the following rules:

1. You may only post quotations or brief snippets (under two sentences), not the full text.
2. You will ensure that any use clearly indicates the author names.
3. You will ensure that any use on the internet will hyperlink each author name directly back to either his or her Casetext user profile or his or her official professional biographical page on an external website.
4. You will ensure that any use on the internet includes a hyperlink to the page on Casetext where the Republished Content appears, or to a version of the post or article previously published outside of Casetext Services.

For any other uses of Republished Content, you must obtain the express permission of the author or copyright holder. If you have any questions about sharing posts, annotations, or articles in accordance with Creative Commons or otherwise in compliance with this Agreement, including without limitation whether you're dealing with Original Content or Republished Content, or guidance on how to add the appropriate hyperlinks, contact us at [contact@casetext.com](mailto:contact@casetext.com).

## E. Real Identities Policy

Casetext Services are powered by a massive database of content -- legal analysis, commentary, case summaries, and updates -- published by a community of attorneys, academics, and other experts on the Casetext website.

**All Casetext users must use their real names and identities when participating in the Casetext community**. That means that if you register as a Casetext user (which you are required to do to publish content on Casetext), you must provide Casetext with accurate registration information, including your real name and email address. We reserve the right to cancel or refuse registration at our discretion, and users should expect that their subscription may be terminated without notice if we suspect a user has entered personal information that is inaccurate, deceptive, or designed to hide the user's true identity. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. You must notify Casetext immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Casetext will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account. You may never use another user's account without permission.

## F. Publisher Obligations

You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Casetext users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other users. Casetext shall have no liability for your interactions with other users, or for any user's action or inaction.

**Governing Law**. You agree that: (i) the Services shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Services shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Santa Clara County, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.

**Arbitration.** READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM CASETEXT. For any dispute with Casetext, you agree to first contact us at contact@casetext.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Casetext has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, "Claims"), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/). The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless you and Casetext agree otherwise. If you are using the Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Services for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney's fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Casetext from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.

**Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.** WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICES FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND CASETEXT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.

**Assignment**. This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Casetext without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.

**Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement**. Casetext may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Casetext in our sole discretion. Casetext reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. Casetext is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us.

We'd love to hear your questions, concerns, and feedback about this policy. If you have any suggestions for us, feel free to let us know at&nbsp; [policies@casetext.com](mailto:policies@casetext.com).

The End.
